##To do list:

* To answer questions 4 and 5 of the General Problem Case Description
* ~~To code the heuristic you have just defined as a subclass of the EvaluationFunction class.~~
* To use this heuristic with Best First Search and compare the quality of the solution provided by Best First Search against that obtained with Depth First Search and also the one obtained with Breadth First Search. In order to make this comparison try 2 or 3 different orderings of your operators. One of the orderings must be: Move-2Steps, Move-4Steps, Move-1Step.
* ~~To implement A* Search as a subclass of the HeuristicSearchMethod class. You must implement the simple version of the algorithm, Basic (or Tree) Search as we called it in class, that DOESNâ€™T CHECK FOR REPEATED STATES. Use the pseudo-code in your slides as reference.~~
* Use your A* Search algorithm with an evaluation function that uses the heuristic you have previously defined. Compare the solution provided by your algorithm against that provided by each of the previous algorithms: Best First Search, Depth First Search and Breadth First Search. Try the operator ordering: Move-2Steps, Move-4Steps, Move-1Step.
* Think about the State Space of the problem you are addressing and answer: If you implemented Best First Search in its simple version (Basic Search) NOT CHECKING FOR REPEATED STATES (alike A* above), is it possible for some instance of the problem that this simple version of Best First Search got stuck within a loop unable to provide a solution? And how about your implementation of A*? Justify your answers.
