##To do list:

* ~~To define/redefine clone() in each object that makes up the problem environment. Make sure you test the clone() method of each environment object before you invoke clone() from elsewhere in your program.~~
* ~~To update the method effect() of your Operator subclasses in such a way that effect() makes use of clone().~~
* ~~To define a method solve(Search algorithm) within the BlackWhiteSquares class that solves the whole problem and fix bugs. This is your first complete system version.~~
* ~~To answer question 3 of the General Problem Case Description.~~
* ~~To analyse the performance of your system with Blind Search Methods DEPTH FIRST SEARCH and BREADTH FIRST SEARCH. You will do this for the problem instance described by the .xml file accessible in ALUD2. In accordance with the learning goals specified above, for each Blind method you are required to:~~
	* ~~Analyse how different orderings of Operator instances in the list of Operators of your BlackWhiteSquaresProblem instance affect the solution found by the search algorithm. Explain your findings.~~
	* ~~Discuss the quality of the solution provided by the system and determine whether it may be improved and if so, how.~~
	* ~~Time required by the search algorithm to produce a solution and discuss whether it may be improved without compromising the quality of the solution (or even improving it?) and if so, how.~~
