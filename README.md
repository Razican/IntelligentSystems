Intelligent Systems project

##To do list:

+ To answer questions 1 and 2 of the General Problem Case Description PART 2. These questions have nothing to do with Hill-Climbing in itself. To answer them you need to revise the second part of Chapter 4.
+ To implement methods isFullyObserved() and gatherPercepts() of your BlWhSquaresProblem object.
+ To code ON-LINE Hill Climbing as a subclass of the HeuristicSearchMethod  class. This object will use the heuristic you defined in your last submission and methods isFullyObserved() and gatherPercepts() from your BlWhSquaresProblem object.
+ Use your system with the two XML files available in ALUD2; namely  blackwhitesquares1.xml and blackwhitesquaresPartialpercepts1.xml.
Your algorithm should work as regular Hill-Climbing when the problem environment is fully observable and in an ON-LINE fashion when the problem environment is partially observable. Your algorithm also differs from regular Hill-Climbing in that it will keep the name of each operator applied so that on completing its search, the system can produce the sequence of actions leading to the last state reached by the algorithm.
+ Explain whether your system provides a satisfactory solution to the new
problem setting you are facing in this second part of the project.
+ As part of your system testing you must display the heuristic value of the current state and the heuristic value of its best successor. This will help you understand the behavior of the algorithm and assess its adequacy as a solving
method for the new problem setting.
